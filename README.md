My expertise includes:
- **Backend Development:** Python (Django, Flask), REST APIs, Celery
- **DevOps:** CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Monitoring & Logging
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Mentorship & Education:** Empowering the next generation of developers

I am also exploring **entrepreneurial projects**, focusing on innovative platforms that impact everyday lives, combining technology, efficiency, and creativity. 🌍✨

Let’s build something amazing together!
